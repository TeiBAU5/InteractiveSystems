Link
WASD or Arrow Keys to move
The number keys (or keypad) are for using items, 2 shoots an arrow, 3 uses a boomerang, 4 will throw a flame, and 5 will place a bomb (pressing 5 while a bomb is active will explode the bomb).
The z or n key is used to start a wooden sword attack, when at full health this will also shoot out a sword beam.
The e key is used to make Link take damage (Link starts out with 8 health as seen in the top left corner).
